# Demo Project (Authentication)
This is a authentication endpoint over NodeJS using packages body-parser, mongoose, bcrypt, express.
It's routes are tested, and contains a basic CRUD model that respects the auth Middleware.  
Hosted on AWS EC2, read to be hosted as a container over docker, CI over Jenkins runing the lint and after runing Unit tests. As it is just a Authentication Module, has a simple Top-Down in the Unit tests that check if the middleware still working for endpoints that requires auth.  

Developed following TDD.

## Using the project

There are 3 ways to see the project runing, for the first two you need to download the project.
Both should be executed from server/auth directory.

### Docker

Using docker-compose you can build the image of the folder and run the project, the only command you need as long as you have Docker installed is : 

```
docker-compose build && docker-compose up
```
Docker has no test container neither a command to force the tests to run before the application.


### Locally

Reach the directory specified and run ```npm install```.
It will download the necessary package for your local machine.

###### Testing
```
npm run test
```
###### Executing Locally 

Copy the secretdocker.js to src/secret.js and change 'yoursecrethere' for your secret.   ```appSecret : yoursecrethere```

[Install mongodb](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) and run in port 27017.

Then ```node src/server.js```.

###### Using Hosted Application

The application is hosted over www.whyushouldhireme.com as described in the Intro and the Routes.
